Name: Pranav Srinivas Venkatesh
Matriculation Number: 1678255
Master Thesis: Machine Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization

Data Folder:
-------------
- Contains all locally saved data files.
- These data files are loaded from external sources and stored for further processing or modeling.

Data Download and caching.ipynb:
----------------------------------
- This notebook contains the script for downloading data from an external API.
- The downloaded data is then saved into the 'Data' folder for local use.

Model_artifacts Folder:
-------------------------
- Stores all pre-trained machine learning models and scalers.
- These artifacts are used for inference or further evaluation without retraining the models.

Model_name_2022_final_code.ipynb:
-----------------------------------
- Contains the complete code for running forecasting tasks specifically for the year 2022.
- Includes data loading, preprocessing, model loading/training, prediction, and result saving and portfolio optimization steps.

Model_name_2024_final_code.ipynb:
-----------------------------------
- Contains the complete code for running forecasting tasks specifically for the year 2024.
- Includes data loading, preprocessing, model loading/training, prediction, and result saving and portfolio optimization steps.

Model-wise-scores.ipynb:
--------------------------
- Contains ETF-wise scores for all forecasting models across all time horizons.

requirements.txt:
------------------
- Lists all required Python libraries along with their specific version numbers.
- Ensures environment consistency across different systems for reproducibility.
